Want to see what it looks like before downloading? Two zero-install options:

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software)
&nbsp;
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software)

- **StackBlitz** — full app runs in your browser via WebContainers (Node + Express + React all simulated in-page). ~30 seconds to boot. Your sandbox is private — nothing leaves your tab. Data resets when you close the tab.
- **GitHub Codespaces** — cloud dev environment with the project pre-loaded. Click *Run* on `npm start` and the forwarded port opens the live app. Requires GitHub login. Free 60 hours/month per personal account.

> ⚠️ **Both are demos.** For real day-to-day billing use the local install (Quick Start below). Your business data deserves to live on your own machine, not in a browser sandbox or a cloud VM. The whole point of this software is that.

## Your First Invoice in 5 Minutes

A step-by-step guide for the *very first* invoice you create after installing. Targeted at users who've never used billing software before.

### Before you start
You need: Windows 10/11 PC, ~50 MB free disk, your business name + bank details (optional, can be added later). **No coding knowledge required.** No internet needed after install.

### Step 1 — Install (1 minute)

1. Download the project as a ZIP from <https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>
2. Right-click the downloaded ZIP → **Extract All** → pick a folder you'll remember (e.g. `Documents\FreeGSTBill`)
3. Open that folder → **double-click `Install FreeGSTBill.bat`**
4. Let it run — it installs Node.js automatically if you don't have it, then sets everything up. Takes 1–2 minutes the first time
5. The app opens in your browser at `http://localhost:47371` when done

> 💡 **Tip:** Click the small **Install App** icon in your browser's address bar to make the app open in its own window like Tally or Word — no browser chrome, looks and feels native.

### Step 2 — Set up your business profile (1 minute)

The Welcome Wizard appears automatically on first launch.

1. **Welcome screen** → pick your region:
   - 🇮🇳 **India only** — enables GST, GSTR-1/3B, UPI QR, E-Way Bill
   - 🌍 **Outside India** — enables VAT / SST / MwSt / TVA labels for 21 other countries
   - 🌐 **Both** — keeps everything visible (default)
2. **Business Details** → fill in your business name and address. Add GSTIN if you have one (leave blank if not GST-registered). PAN is optional.
3. **Bank & UPI** → add one bank account + your UPI ID so clients can pay you. You can add more accounts later from Settings → Payment Accounts.
4. Click **Done** → you land on the empty Dashboard

### Step 3 — Create your first invoice (2 minutes)

1. Click **+ New Invoice** in the sidebar
2. Pick the invoice type: **Tax Invoice** for GST-registered sales, **Bill of Supply** for exempt goods, **Proforma** for quotes, **Delivery Challan** for goods movement
3. Pick **📦 Goods** or **⏱ Services** at the top — this drives the default unit (Nos for goods, Hrs for services)
4. Type the client's name in the **Bill To** field. If you've billed them before they auto-suggest. Otherwise click **+ Save as new client** and fill the modal.
5. Add line items in the table:
   - **Description** — what you sold/did
   - **Qty** — how much
   - **Unit** — pick from the dropdown (Nos/Kg/Ltr for goods; Hrs/Day/Session for services). Click **＋ Add custom…** for things like *Carat* / *Bundle*
   - **Rate** — price per unit
   - **Tax %** — picks from your country's standard rates (5/12/18/28% for India; 5% for UAE; etc.)
6. Click **Download PDF** in the top-right

That's it. The PDF saves to `Saved Invoices/<Client Name>/<Month>/` and the invoice is logged in your bills list with a unique number.

### Step 4 — Send to your client (1 minute)

After clicking Download PDF you get three sharing options inline:

- 📱 **WhatsApp** — opens WhatsApp Web/Desktop with the PDF link prefilled to the client's number
- 📧 **Email** — opens your default mail app with the invoice summary
- ☁ **Google Drive** — auto-uploads (optional, requires you to configure your Google Client ID once in Settings)

### Step 5 — Track payment (whenever)

Open the Dashboard. The invoice shows in the list with a status badge.

- Click the **💰** icon to record a payment (full or partial) — date, mode, note
- The status updates automatically (`unpaid` → `partial` → `paid`)
- Overdue invoices get a red row + days-overdue counter automatically once the due date passes
- Use the **🔔 Notifications** bell in the sidebar to see overdue invoices and upcoming GST filing deadlines

### What to do next

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore:

- **Recurring invoices** — tick "🔁 Make this recurring" in the Customize panel of any invoice. The app auto-generates it monthly/weekly/yearly on your chosen date.
- **Multi-currency** — billing an overseas client? Open Customize → Currency → USD/EUR/GBP/AED/etc. The PDF renders the right symbol, locale formatting, and amount-in-words.
- **GST Returns** — sidebar → GST Returns. Filter by month/quarter/FY, click **JSON Export** to download GSTR-1 / GSTR-3B ready for the GST portal offline tool.
- **GSTR-2B Reconciliation** — download your 2B JSON from gst.gov.in, click Import in our 2B tab — we auto-match against your purchase records and flag mismatches.
- **TDS / TCS** — Customize → tick TDS or TCS, pick a section (194Q / 206C(1H) / etc.). The Reports view aggregates these for Form 26Q / 27EQ filing.

📖 **Full walkthrough** — see [docs/USER_GUIDE.md](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) or the in-app **User Guide** view (searchable, includes PDF download).

---

## Quick Start / Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (only needed for developer setup)
- **Windows 10/11** (recommended — includes one-click installer)

### Option 1: Windows Installer (Recommended — No Coding Needed)

1. **Download** the ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/releases) or [click here](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. **Extract** the folder anywhere on your computer
3. **Double-click** `Install FreeGSTBill.bat`
4. The app opens automatically in your browser at **http://localhost:47371**

> **That's it.** No terminal. No commands. The app starts automatically when you turn on your PC.
> A desktop shortcut and Start Menu entry are created for you.

> **Why port 47371?** It's in the unassigned IANA range, well above the 3000-range that every Node / React / Vite / Express dev server fights over. If something on your machine somehow already owns 47371, the server auto-scans up to find a free port and writes the chosen one to `data/port.txt` — the Start.bat launcher always opens whichever URL is correct, so you never need to remember a number. Always use the Desktop shortcut.

### Option 2: Developer Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software.git
cd Free-GST-Billing-Software
npm install

# Windows
npm run dev:win

# macOS / Linux
npm run dev
```

Dev server: `http://localhost:5173` | API: `http://localhost:47371`

**Production build:**
```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

## Install as a Desktop App (PWA)

Free GST Billing Software is a **Progressive Web App** — once installed, it gets its own icon, its own window, and behaves exactly like a regular Windows / macOS / Linux app. No browser chrome, no localhost URL visible to the user.

### How to install as a PWA

1. Open **http://localhost:47371** in Chrome / Edge / Brave (any Chromium browser)
2. Click the orange **Install as Desktop App** banner at the top — or the **➕ install icon** in the address bar
3. The app opens in its own window with the GST Billing Software icon in your Start Menu / taskbar

### After installation — manifest shortcuts

Right-click the pinned PWA icon (Windows taskbar / Start Menu / Edge's app launcher) and you get a jump-list:

- 🆕 **New Invoice** → straight to the invoice form
- 📊 **Dashboard** → recent invoices and stats
- 📋 **GST Returns** → GSTR-1 / 3B / 2B reconciliation
- ⚙ **Settings** → business profile, accounts, modules

No need to land on the Dashboard first — jump directly to the most-used flow.

### Offline-first

The PWA caches its full app shell + fonts + icons on first install. Even if your localhost server isn't running for some reason, the app still loads (and tells you the server is offline rather than just showing a blank page). Service worker auto-updates the cache when you upgrade.

> 🪟 **Coming in v2.0:** Native `.exe` installer (Tauri repackage) with code-signed binary, Add/Remove Programs entry, system tray icon, and native auto-update. The PWA flow stays as the developer / power-user fallback.

## How to Self-File GST Returns

Free GST Billing Software auto-generates all the data you need for GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B filing. Here's the workflow:

```
Step 1 ──► Enter invoices throughout the month as you normally would
              │
Step 2 ──► Go to GST Returns page → Review GSTR-1 data (B2B, B2C, HSN, Credit Notes)
              │
Step 3 ──► Export GSTR-1 JSON → Upload directly to gst.gov.in
              │
Step 4 ──► Review GSTR-3B summary → Copy figures into the GST portal and file
              │
Step 5 ──► Mark the return as filed to track your compliance status
```

The app includes a **step-by-step interactive filing guide** with screenshots and tips for both GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B. It even covers NIL return filing for months with no activity.

> **No CA needed for basic GST filing.** The app does all the calculations — you just upload and confirm.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React 19, Vite 7 |
| **Backend** | Express 5 (Node.js) |
| **PDF Generation** | jsPDF + html2canvas |
| **Icons** | Lucide React |
| **QR Codes** | qrcode |
| **Security** | DOMPurify (XSS protection) |
| **Storage** | File-based JSON — no database needed |
| **Offline** | PWA with service worker caching |

> **No database. No Docker. No cloud setup.** Clone, install, run. Your data lives in a simple `data/` folder as plain JSON files.

- **Community-driven** — features are built based on what users actually need

## Data Privacy & Security

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Where is my data stored?** | In a `data/` folder on your computer as plain JSON files. No server, no cloud, no database. |
| **Can anyone access my invoices?** | No. The app runs on `localhost` — not accessible from the internet or other computers. |
| **What if I uninstall?** | Your `data/` folder stays untouched. Reinstall anytime and everything is still there. |
| **Do I need internet?** | Only for the first install (`npm install`). After that, everything works offline. |
| **How do I backup?** | Settings → Export Data → save JSON file. Import on any machine. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Free GST Billing Software really free?
Yes — MIT licensed open-source software. No subscription, no premium tier, no "free trial" that expires, no usage limits. The full feature set is available to every user forever. We make zero rupees from this directly.

### Will my data be sent to the cloud?
No. All your invoices, clients, products, and settings are stored as plain JSON files in a `data/` folder next to the app on your computer. Nothing leaves your machine unless you explicitly turn on the optional Google Drive backup feature (in which case it goes to *your own* Google Drive, not ours).

### Can I file GST returns directly from this software?
The software generates **GSTR-1**, **GSTR-3B**, and **GSTR-2B reconciliation** data in CSV and the GSTN offline-tool JSON format. You upload these files directly to gst.gov.in — no third-party intermediary. The built-in step-by-step filing guide walks you through the GSTN portal once you've downloaded the files.

### Does it work without internet?
Yes, completely. After installation everything runs on `localhost:47371` on your computer. The only optional internet-using features are Google Drive backup, the in-app update notifier (checks GitHub for new versions), and WhatsApp sharing.

### Can I bill international clients?
Yes. Free GST Billing Software supports **22 countries** with locale-correct currency formatting, country-aware tax labels (GST / VAT / SST / MwSt / TVA / PPN / Sales Tax), and amount-in-words in the right currency name (Dollars, Dirhams, Pounds, Rand, Naira, Pesos, etc.). Set your Region Preference in Settings to *International* or *Both*.

### What invoice formats are supported?
**Tax Invoice**, **Proforma / Estimate**, **Bill of Supply** (for exempt goods or non-GST sellers), **Composition scheme invoice** (with Rule 46A declaration), **Credit Note**, **Delivery Challan**.

### Does it support multiple businesses?
Yes. You can add unlimited business profiles (each with its own GSTIN, bank accounts, logo, signature, and country setting). Switch between them with one click in the header.

### Does it run on Mac or Linux?
The `.bat` installers are Windows-only, but the app itself works on macOS and Linux via `npm install` + `npm start`. See the [Quick Start](#quick-start--installation) section.

### What happens to my data when the app updates?
Updates only refresh the app code and dependencies. Your `data/` folder (invoices, clients, products, settings) and `Saved Invoices/` PDF archive are **never touched**. The updater also backs them up to `%TEMP%` as a third safety net before pulling new code.

### Is there a mobile app?
Not yet — the PWA installs as a desktop app today. A native Android app is on the v2.x roadmap.

### Can I import data from Tally / Vyapar / Excel?
Currently CSV import is supported for products. Direct Tally XML import is on the v1.7 roadmap. Free-form Excel import requires manual mapping today.
