2. Click "SEARCH" button.
3. The page will show all returns for that period. Find "GSTR-1" tile.
4. Click "PREPARE ONLINE" if you have fewer than 500 invoices. Click "PREPARE OFFLINE" if you have 500+ invoices (you'll download the offline tool, import the JSON from this app, and upload).
5. For QRMP scheme users: Select the quarter end month. You file quarterly but can use IFF (Invoice Furnishing Facility) monthly for B2B invoices.
